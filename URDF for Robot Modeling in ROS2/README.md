# URDF for Robot Modeling in ROS2
The final project of this course is to implement a robotic arm through a URDF file.

## Course Content
This course teaches how URDF files work, and how to create them to model any robot.
* How to build a visual robot model with URDF
* How to add physical properties to a URDF Model (Collision, Frictionsâ€¦)
* How to use XACRO to clean up URDF files.
* How to use URDF in Gazebo-ROS ecosystem.
* How to use URDF-XACRO in ROS2 systems
